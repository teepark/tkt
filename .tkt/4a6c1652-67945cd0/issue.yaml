description: 'issues and events are currently placed in the filesystem by a 32-digit
  random hex string


  they will have:

  numerical timestamp of created time and a shorter random hex string, concated together


  this way we can sort filenames beforehand, give them numbers/names based on *that*
  sort,

  and therefore not have to load all of them to figure out what each one''s name/number
  is'
