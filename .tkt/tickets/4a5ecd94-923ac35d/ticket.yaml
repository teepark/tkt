description: 'idea needs to be filled out, but:


  - a ticket can have multiple dependencies

  - but there can be no cycles

  - the sorting of tickets is overridden by dependency relationships

  - starting a ticket with an open dependency requires a confirmantion,

  - closing a ticket with an open dependency is not allowed (confirm to remove the
  dependency)


  command:

  depends/dependency <tkt>

  this enters an interactive mode, unless options are provided'
