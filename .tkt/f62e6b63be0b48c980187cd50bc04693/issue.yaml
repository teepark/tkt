description: "a couple of options for how to get screen views of Model subclass instances\n\
  \n - a View base class, whose subclasses register the type of object\n   they are\
  \ meant to display, teach Command to find the right views\n - view methods of Model\
  \ subclasses, teach Command to call them\n\ni think i like the first one better,\
  \ especially for plugins"
