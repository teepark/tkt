comment: "i have done a bunch of those, here's what's left:\n\n- add to init command,\
  \ create components field of Project as an empty list\n  - rest of the app knows\
  \ to treat an empty components field as the project name being the only component\n\
  - \"set-component\" still needs a name and implementation\n- \"add-component\" still\
  \ needs a name and implementation\n- add to status command, let it take an argument,\
  \ then only list status of tickets for that component\n- override edit to allow\
  \ changing the component"
