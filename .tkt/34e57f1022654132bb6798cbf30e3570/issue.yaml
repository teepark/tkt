description: "what the components plugin should accomplish:\n\n - rename tickets by\
  \ component to <component name>-<order in component>\n - add a component field to\
  \ Issues, whose value is the component name\n - add a component field to Project,\
  \ a list of component names\n - add to add/new command, select a component (if more\
  \ than 1)\n - add to init command, create 1 component with the name of the project\n\
  \   - rethink this?\n - ditz's \"set-component\" is a crappy name. better ideas?\n\
  \ - ditz's \"add-component\" is equally crappy.\n - add to show/view command, let\
  \ argument be a component name,\n   then limit shown tickets to just that component\n\
  \ - override edit command to allow changing the component\n\ni think that's it"
