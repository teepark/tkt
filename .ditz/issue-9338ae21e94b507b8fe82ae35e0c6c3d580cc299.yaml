title: components plugin
desc: |-
  what the components plugin should accomplish:
  
   - rename tickets by component to <component name>-<order in component>
   - add a component field to Issues, whose value is the component name
   - add a component field to Project, a list of component names
   - add to add/new command, select a component (if more than 1)
   - add to init command, create 1 component with the name of the project
     - rethink this?
   - ditz's "set-component" is a crappy name. better ideas?
   - ditz's "add-component" is equally crappy.
   - add to show/view command, let argument be a component name,
     then limit shown tickets to just that component
   - override edit command to allow changing the component
  
  i think that's it

    i have done a bunch of those, here's what's left:
    
    - add to init command, create components field of Project as an empty list
      - rest of the app knows to treat an empty components field as the project name being the only component
    - "set-component" still needs a name and implementation
    - "add-component" still needs a name and implementation
    - add to status command, let it take an argument, then only list status of tickets for that component
    - override edit to allow changing the component
