title: model object views
desc: |-
  a couple of options for how to get screen views of Model subclass instances
  
   - a View base class, whose subclasses register the type of object
     they are meant to display, teach Command to find the right views
   - view methods of Model subclasses, teach Command to call them
  
  i think i like the first one better, especially for plugins

    never mind, going with option 2. started work on the first and it was
    frameworky and over-engineered. all we need is a few simple functions
