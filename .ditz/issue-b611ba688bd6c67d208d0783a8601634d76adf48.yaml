desc: |-
  create a command base class that:
   - builds an optparse.OptionParser based on overridden subclass attributes
   - has a MetaClass that registers subclasses by name (lowercase name, actually)
   - has a main() that calls the main() of the proper subclass

    tkt.commands.Command now uses tkt.plugins.MetaPluggable as its metaclass,
    but MetaPluggable isn't written yet (and is part of a ticket #6)

    the top-level main() isn't attached to Command, it's just in the commands module
    
    also, Command no longer depends on an unwritten class, I just made the metaclass right there
