title: starting plugins
desc: |-
  start with feature parity with base ditz:
  
   - components
   - releases
  
  then move on to matching existing ditz plugins (that i like)
  
   - labels
   - claiming
  
  i also like git integration but it's pretty brittle in ditz
  right now, not the model to follow
  
  then, features in addition to what is found in ditz (even plugins):
  
   - dependencies
type: :feature
component: tkt
release: "0.2"

  - changed status from unstarted to in_progress
  - components first, as that's probably the bigger feature
