Installation
=================

With git::

  git clone git://github.com/teepark/tkt.git
  cd tkt
  sudo python setup.py install

From a downloaded tarball::

  tar xzf tkt-tarball-file-name.tar.gz
  cd tarball-file-name
  sudo python setup.py install

if you are in a virtualenv you won't need the ``sudo``

Usage
=================

tkt is a command-line program that accepts a variety of sub-commands.

A lot of care has been taken to ensure that commands are easy to find,
learn more about and use. The command ``tkt help`` is your friend.

The ``tkt help`` command alone will present a list of all the available
sub-commands (the default list will grow if you add plugins to a
project). ``tkt help <command-name>`` (replacing <command-name> with an
actual command) will display a help message for that command. You can
also get to the help message of a command with
``tkt <command-name> -h`` or ``--help``

Most of the commands will probably be exactly what you expect them to
be. ``tkt add`` adds a new ticket, ``tkt close`` closes one, etc.
